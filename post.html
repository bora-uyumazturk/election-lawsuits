          Since the November 3rd General Election, President Donald Trump's
          legal team and various GOP groups have filed dozens of lawsuits
          challenging the results input in key swing states such as
          Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona. These lawsuits generally challenge
          the validity of the votes cast, seeking to overturn enough votes
          to put the results in doubt. Using data from
          <a href='democracydocket.com'>democracydocket.com</a>, we looked
          at the progression of the legal strategy over time looking for
          trends and patterns.

            These cases are distributed among six states. Pennsylvania and Michigan
            have the most cases with five each.

            These are cases filed between <strong>November 3rd</strong>
            and <strong>November 10th</strong>, the week following election day.
            Before the election results were even announced, Trump and his legal
            had already filed over 11 lawsuits, 5 in Pennsylvania alone.
